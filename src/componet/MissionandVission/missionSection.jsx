              In Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus emphasizes the importance of loving God
              with all our heart, soul, and mind, and loving our neighbors as
              ourselves, stating that all the law and the Prophets are based on
              these two commandments. In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus commands his
              followers to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
              in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them
              to obey all that He has commanded. Both passages highlight the
              core of Christian teaching: love for God and others, and the
              mission to spread this love through discipleship and obedience.
