              Have you ever wondered why the church was named "Gateway"? As at
              1960, there was only an entry point from the northern part of the
              country. At the site are of the church was the airport. Also, it
              was and still is the only south-north route for the Nigeria
              Railway. At that time, hardly could anybody come to visit the
              Western Region without passing through the Sanngo area of the
              city. The worshippers, through the divine inspiration as voiced by
              Deacon Lawore, then leader of the preaching station, then
              considered "GATEWAY" BAPTIST CHURCH as the name because it was,
              and still is the Gateway to Heaven, Paradise, Saviour and
              salvation as well as, break-through, success, miracles, blessings,
              redemption and long life and prosperity.
